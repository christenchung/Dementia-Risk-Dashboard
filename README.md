# Diagnostic Criteria of Alzheimer's Dementia 

## Project Background

The gradual onset and nature of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) impedes diagnosis. Cognitive impairment prevent patients from admitting their symptoms to clinicians. Given the lack of a cure, delayed AD diagnoses stress families and have costly repercussions. Early diagnoses may allow time to plan for future care and aid in saving money [(Fulton & Dolezel, 2019)](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/9/9/212). I examined Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) data using [OASIS-1](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/home/oasis-1/) and [OASIS-2](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/home/oasis-2/) to explore AD's relationship with various factors. The objective is to contribute analysis for decision making of AD diagnostic criteria.
