## Project Background

Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S., the most common culprit of dementia, and incurable [(Skaria, 2022)](https://www.ajmc.com/view/the-economic-and-societal-burden-of-alzheimer-disease-managed-care-considerations). It is characterized by cognitive decline, significantly impeding quality of life. Diagnosis is difficult and time consuming. This is due to AD's silent, gradual onset and cognitive impairment. On average, patients are asymptomatic for 3-11 years before noticeable changes [(Mayo Clinic)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers-stages/art-20048448). After, cognitive impairment is already interfering with daily life, it exacerbates self-care and attending to one's own health. Early AD diagnoses reduce future costs from otherwise worsened AD. This provides patients and families time to start treatment, address risk factors, enroll in clinical trials, and to plan for long-term care [(Skaria, 2022)](https://www.ajmc.com/view/the-economic-and-societal-burden-of-alzheimer-disease-managed-care-considerations). During this time, cognition can be improved by targeting intellectual engagement, exercise, tobacco smoking, eating habits, diabetes, hypertension, and body mass index. Early AD diagnosis is cost-effective for patients, families, and Medicare/Medicaid, as demonstrated by several studies. Early AD diagnosis was found to reduce annual patient cost by 9-14%. By 2060, AD in Americans is projected to double, tripling health care costs to greater than $1 trillion. Therefore, cost reduction by $4,300 per patient per year, achieved by early diagnosis, is significant. 

I examined Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) data using [OASIS-1](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/home/oasis-1/) and [OASIS-2](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/home/oasis-2/) to explore the various stages of AD.
