# Clinical Features of Alzheimer's Dementia 

## Project Background

Diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is difficult and time consuming. This is due to AD's silent, gradual onset and cognitive impairment. The silent early stage lasts 3-11 years before noticeable changes [(Mayo Clinic)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers-stages/art-20048448). After, cognitive impairment is already interfering with daily life. It exacerbates self-care and attending to one's own health. Given the lack of a cure, delayed AD diagnoses stress families and have costly repercussions. Early diagnoses may allow time to plan for future care and aid in saving money [(Fulton & Dolezel, 2019)](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/9/9/212). I examined Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) data using [OASIS-1](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/home/oasis-1/) and [OASIS-2](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/home/oasis-2/) to explore AD's relationship with various factors. The objective is to contribute analysis for decision making of AD diagnostic criteria.
