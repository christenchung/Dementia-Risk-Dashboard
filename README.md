## Project Background

Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S., the most common culprit of dementia, and incurable [(Skaria, 2022)](https://www.ajmc.com/view/the-economic-and-societal-burden-of-alzheimer-disease-managed-care-considerations). It is characterized by cognitive decline, significantly impeding quality of life. Half of patients with AD are diagnosed. This may be due to AD's silent and gradual onset. On average, patients are asymptomatic for 3-11 years before noticeable changes [(Mayo Clinic)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers-stages/art-20048448). Further, tests confirming AD are either invasive, time consuming, or inaccessible [(Skaria, 2022)](https://www.ajmc.com/view/the-economic-and-societal-burden-of-alzheimer-disease-managed-care-considerations). AD often reveals itself after significant disease progression. Early AD diagnoses reduce future costs from otherwise worsened AD. This provides patients and families time to start treatment, address risk factors, enroll in clinical trials, and to plan for long-term care. During this time, cognition can be improved by targeting intellectual engagement, exercise, tobacco smoking, eating habits, diabetes, hypertension, and body mass index. Early AD diagnosis is cost-effective for patients, families, and Medicare/Medicaid, as demonstrated by several studies. Early AD diagnosis was found to reduce annual patient cost by 9-14%, or $4,300 per patient per year. By 2060, AD in Americans is projected to double, tripling health care costs to greater than $1 trillion. Therefore, cost reduction, that could be achieved by early diagnosis, is significant in alleviating economic burden. By exploring Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) data, [OASIS-1](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/home/oasis-1/) and [OASIS-2](https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/home/oasis-2/), I explore the various stages of AD in order to find signs that may predict its silent early stage.
